Create your session ideas as an issue in this GitHub repository!

It doesn't matter what form of idea you have, such as "I'd like to talk about this," "I'd like to discuss this," or "I'd love to hear about this".

Please add a üëç or other reaction to ideas that sound interesting and that you would love to participate in.

We will allocate the collected ideas to a timetable over two sessions: morning meeting and snack meeting.

Tracks A and B will be conducted via Zoom Webinar. If we need more than that, we will open a new voice channel on Discord.
There is no limit to the number of tracks, so please feel free to submit your ideas.

Please note simultaneous translation will not be provided for the unconference.
